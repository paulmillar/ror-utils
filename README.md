== ROR utils ==

The [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/) is a
community-led project to maintain a database of research institutes.
This repository contains a collection of utilities for working with
the information maintained and provided by ROR.

The `bin` directory contains miscellaneous scripts.

The `map-to-rdf` directory contains configuration to map the
ROR-supplied JSON data to an equivalent set of RDF-triple assertions.
Further rdetails are available in that directory's README file.
