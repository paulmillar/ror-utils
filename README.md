# ROR utils

The [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/) is a
community-led project to maintain a database of research institutes.
This repository contains a collection of utilities for working with
the information maintained and provided by ROR.

The `bin` directory contains scripts for working with ROR data dumps.
More details are available in that directory.

The `map-to-rdf` directory contains configuration to map the
ROR-supplied JSON data to an equivalent set of RDF-triple assertions.
Further rdetails are available in that directory's README file.
